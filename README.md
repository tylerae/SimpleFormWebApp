# Overview Version 2 

### This repository is my first dive into using React js. I have had previous experince with HTML and CSS but in order to prepare myself for builiding a personal website, I needed to gain skills in JS and React. I created a simple form using react that allows the user to enter their name and email. Certain methods are in place to update the objects and check for valid entries. In addition to this project, I have also added the addition of a cloud database. The database is ran through google firebase and is set up to store the user information found in the reaact form.

# Development Environment
