# Overview

### This repository is my first dive into using React js. I have had previous experince with HTML and CSS but in order to prepare myself for builiding a personal website, I needed to gain skills in JS and React. I created a simple form using react that allows the user to enter their name and email. Certain methods are in place to update the objects and check for valid entries.

# Web Page

### Currently there is one web page that takes in the information. This is also going to be used when I begin utilizing databases. 

# Development Environment

### This project uses HTML for a basic front end template, CSS for simple UI design, and react for the formatting and dynmaic processes.
